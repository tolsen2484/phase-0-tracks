# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	-Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files and merge revisions made by different people. Useful because it allows other people to edit it and you can track down the mistakes easier. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	-Branch creates a copy of the master. Useful because you can edit different versions or other people can edit, and you can merge all or some of the edits to one copy.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	-Commit, or "revision" is an individual change to a file (or set of files). A good commit message describes the change
* What is a merge conflict?
	-Markers to show the discrepencies in a merge. Red flag to show it needs to be reviewed.
