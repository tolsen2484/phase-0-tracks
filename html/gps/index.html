What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	-To give more meaning to the content. 
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	-<nav>, <article>, <aside>, <section>
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	-Learned how to make snippets and I think it will be very handy later. Especially as we adapt our own styles. It will save a ton of time. 
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept?
	-I think just learning the new elements such as article, main, section, etc..  But after doing more and more examples, I think I'll be fine.
